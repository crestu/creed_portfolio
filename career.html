                Van Gogh's career began in the late 1880s after he moved to Paris. While his initial artistic attempts were darker and reflected his own personal turmoil, here he was influenced by the bright colors and a lighter pallet. Here he began close bonds with fellow artists and started to gain recognition in avant-garde communities.<br>
                Though he gained attention as an artist, he still struggled with his mental health. In 1888 he cut off part of his ear and was voluntarily admitted into a mental insitution. During this time he suffered from manic depresive episodes and hallucinations.<br>
                Despite these challenges, it was during his stay at the asylum that he painted his most famous works, "The Starry Night" and "Sunflowers". Much of his art focused on nature, landscapes and still lifes. He also often painted self portraints. <br>
                Vincent used art as a means of expressing himself and displaying the beauty and divinity of nature and the human condition. His art was a tool in his life to focus and transmute his inner suffering into something beautiful to be enjoyed by others.<br>
                Van Goghs career came to a sudden halt at the age of 37 when he tooks his own life.
