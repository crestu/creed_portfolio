                Van gogh was the oldest child of 6 children. His father Theodorus was a minister and his mother Cornelia came from a family of succcessful art dealers. He came from an upper middle-class family. He moved often because of his fathers work. <br>
                In his youth, he did well in school and excelled in language, learning English and French in addition to his native Dutch. He showed interest in drawing but did not recieve any training at this age.<br>
                In his late teens, he worked as an art dealer in London and Paris. During this time he was exposed to a variety of different artworks and styles. He didnt stay in this position for long, however. He did not find it fulfilling and he struggled in his work environment. <br>
                Vincent briefly worked as a missionary in Belgium. He was deeply religious and felt called to be a minister and to help those in need. However, his enthusiasm lead to conflicts with the church and he was eventually dismissed from his mission.<br>
                Throughout his life Vincent struggled with long periods of depression and feelings of isolation.<br>
                At age 27, after facing personal and professional setbacks, he began to pursue art as  a vocation.
